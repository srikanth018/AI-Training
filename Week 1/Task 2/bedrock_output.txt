Input:
Create a Python function that connects to a database with proper error handling following the document's standards.

Output:
Based on the information provided in the "Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure Documentation", I can create a Python function to connect to a database with proper error handling, following the standards outlined in the document. Here's an example implementation:

```python
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import OperationalError

def connect_to_database(host, port, database, user, password):
    """
    Establishes a connection to the specified database.

    Args:
        host (str): The hostname or IP address of the database server.
        port (int): The port number on which the database is listening.
        database (str): The name of the database to connect to.
        user (str): The username to use for authentication.
        password (str): The password associated with the provided username.

    Returns:
        conn (psycopg2.extensions.connection): A connection object if successful.

    Raises:
        OperationalError: If a connection cannot be established due to invalid
            credentials or other operational issues.
        Exception: If any other unexpected exception occurs during the connection
            establishment process.
    """
    try:
        conn = psycopg2.connect(
            host=host,
            port=port,
            database=database,
            user=user,
            password=password
        )
        print("Connection to database successful.")
        return conn
    except OperationalError as e:
        print(f"Unable to connect to the database: {e}")
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        raise

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    host = "localhost"
    port = 5432
    database = "mydb"
    user = "myuser"
    password = "mypassword"

    try:
        conn = connect_to_database(host, port, database, user, password)
        # Perform database operations here
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Here's a breakdown of the key elements in the function based on the standards outlined in the document:

1. **Function Documentation**: The function includes a docstring containing a brief description, parameters with types and descriptions, return value and type, and a list of possible exceptions raised.

2. **Exception Handling**: The function uses specific exception types (`OperationalError` and `Exception`) and never a bare `except` clause. Exceptions are caught in the order of most specific to least specific, and each exception is logged with an appropriate error message.

3. **Error Messages**: The error messages are descriptive and provide context about what went wrong.

4. **Logging**: The function logs a success message when the connection is established and error messages when exceptions occur.

5. **Function Length and Complexity**: The function is relatively short (within the 50-line limit) and has a low cyclomatic complexity.

6. **Naming Conventions**: The function name (`connect_to_database`) follows the snake_case convention and is verb-based. The variable names are also in snake_case and descriptive.

Please note that the document does not provide any specific information about database connection libraries or authentication methods, so I have used the `psycopg2` library for PostgreSQL as an example. You may need to adjust the code based on your specific database and authentication requirements.
